<h1>FireConnect Kotlin MVVM&nbsp;</h1><h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This Android application is a part of my portfolio, developed using the Kotlin programming language. It follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern and leverages the powerful features of Firebase, including Firebase Storage, Firestore, and Realtime Database.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>MVVM Architecture</h3>
<p>The app is structured based on the MVVM architecture, separating concerns into Model, View, and ViewModel components. This architecture promotes a clean and maintainable codebase, making it easier to test and extend.</p>
<h3>Firebase Integration</h3>
<h4>Firebase Storage</h4>
<p>The application utilizes Firebase Storage to handle the storage of files and media. This includes uploading, downloading, and managing files in a secure and scalable manner.</p>
<h4>Firestore</h4>
<p>Firestore is employed as a NoSQL database to store and synchronize structured data. The app interacts with Firestore for efficient data retrieval, storage, and real-time updates.</p>
<h4>Realtime Database</h4>
<p>Firebase Realtime Database is used for real-time data synchronization. It enables instant updates to connected clients when data changes, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.</p>
